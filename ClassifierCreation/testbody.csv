"--------------------------------------------------------------------------What is MIME?MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is thestandard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using theworld-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sendingimages, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain textfiles when it is important that the mail system does not modify any partof the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that arecipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. How can I read a MIME message?Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in usewhich do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growingnumber of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popularMIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at theUniversity of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the hostftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)I",not spam
"n addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translationcapability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you donot have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there isstill hope! There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIMEmessage.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developedat Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from thehost ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versionsavailable for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility witholder forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can alsodecode messages in split-uuencoded format. Does MIME replace UUENCODE?Yes.

"This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and mh.Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the spool.I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will look like "">From "".2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".

In recent years,scientific research has suggested that people who havestrong friendships experience less stress, they recovermore quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to livelonger than the friendless. They are even less susceptibleto the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give toomuch advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now callingattention to the negative health effects of bad friends. ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. HarrietLerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance ofConnection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions wil",not spam
"lrear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thingis to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say thisis bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, asociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.""There's this myth that friendships should last alifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better thatthey end."" That social scientists would wait until now to spotlightthe dangers of bad friends is understandable, consideringthat they have only recently paid close attention tofriendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -between siblings or parents and children - have been seenas more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to leadto depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. Andchildren are seldom seriously affected when friendships gobad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.Lerner said, ""Never on",not spam
"ce have I had anyone write and say mybest friend hits me."" Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at theUniversity of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to therole of friends in emotional and physical health. ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on forstability the way it was in the past, and because peopleare less likely to be living with or near extended familymembers, people are shifting their focus to friendships asa way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" Until the past couple of years, the research on friendshipfocused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to lookat it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,a professor of psychology at Florida InternationalUniversity in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also hasnegative characteristics."" The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yetmeasured the ill effects of bad",not spam
"friendship, Dr. Fehr said.So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,figured out that it is a significant problem. The earlyresearch, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by afriend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, bydrawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advisedpursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends atEnron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can supportantisocial behavior."" Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friendssplit up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor ofpsychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it isoften in cases where one has shared personal information orsecrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friendsuddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It'smore than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silenttreatment is actually malicious."" At least as devastating is an a",not spam
"ffair with the friend'sromantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang inthere and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insultsthe other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people whoresponded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendshipdescribed how, when she was 11, her best friend called her""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastatedthat she feels she has been unable to be fully open withpeople ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some peopleconstantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'llhave a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he orshe finds out."" Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extremekinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not theonly ones. She identifies 21 different varieties.

"are the liar, the person who isoverly dependent, the friend who never listens, the personwho meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor andthe loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyonefrom the person who says let's have a cup of coffee butsomething always comes up at the last minute to someone whopromises to be there for you when you need them, but thenisn't,"" Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasonsto dislike the other one. ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone todiscover there's something important they don't like aboutthe other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the otherperson is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,it may take even more time for one person to meet theother's dislike criteria."" Whether a friendship is worth",not spam
" saving, Dr. Lerner said,""depends on how large the injury is."" ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and letsomething go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturitysometimes to accept another person's limitations."" Acceptance should come easier among friends than amongspouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than onefriend and do not need a full range of emotional supportfrom each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point whereone friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that thefriendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response isto pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personalor intimate details of life, and start being too busy toget together, ever. ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is fareasier to dissolve than marriage.

"hat with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. Why? A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exe",not spam

"Hi all,After about a fortnight, I tried to update my Debian squeeze desktop,and I was using the mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in mirror.

This time, it does say there are about300 updates.I issue a safe-upgrade, but the electricity goes out just as theupdates begin downloading. After I turn the computer back on, issuinga safe-upgrade shows there are no updates!

Bycontrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (suchas completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the processpolls them.I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got thetechnical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronousnetwork I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signalqueue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().--        Kragen Sitaker     Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of 2002.

I usually install lilo to the master boot record (boot=/dev/hdaspecified in /etc/lilo.conf).  But in certain situations it is advantageous toinstall lilo to the boot sector of a primary partition (boot=/dev/hda1) andinstall a DOS-like master boot record program in the master boot record,making the partition containing the lilo boot loader the active partition.For example, on some of our Dell servers one can bring up a ""boot menu"" viathe BIOS setup program by pressing F12 during the POST process.  (This is duringPOST and before the actual boot process.)  Upon completion of POST, the ""BIOSboot menu"" (not to be confused with the boot menu of any boot loader) willbe displayed.

Iwant a Linux box to look just like a Windows box as viewed by a servicetechnician.I could use DOS or Windows to install its master boot record programwith ""fdisk /mbr"" or fixmbr, or whatever, depending on the release ofDOS or Windows, and set the Linux partition active, and that works.

"Hi all,I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wonderingif anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and thescsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 untilprobably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patchand installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went toburn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowedcdburning to work fine.This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).the cdrecord command I was using was    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.isoThe blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it justlocks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it doesreboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messag",not spam
"es/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (mycdr drive and my cdrw).The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was akernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it givesthe same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source forcdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i waswondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had usedwhich maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me muchgood, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know isa)  How to fix the problem ;-)b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm    not very knowledgeable on these things.c)  Should I post a description of this to the ker",not spam

It took two hours to find her.""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung allmy clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""Iknew then there was something special.""Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,who is expecting their first child.Critics of marriage ag",not spam
"encies say they exploit the grinding poverty of womenin developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West thatoften turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailandin search of a wife.""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew Ifound her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept intouch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England andthe couple married.MR. MARRIAGELawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agencyMoylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introductionagency.Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of myknowledge, they have all been successful.""Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men f",not spam

""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to knoweach other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost everyclient has found a potential wife.""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back andthink he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said.

" about 1,000 couples, and lessthan 10 percent have broken up.Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have justarrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are veryimpatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calmdown, OK, we'll talk.""'But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wifeand get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wivesfor include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumaticstress disorder.WHY?Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Criticssay they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable toform relationships in their own country, and on the desperation ofimpoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there isno reason to object.

They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problemwith that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care totheir future husband.""Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why theychoose to use his agency.His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the Britishsingles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who arenot ""God's gift to women.""Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in theirown countries -- and found Thai women attractive.""They don't know how to meet women.

""When I met my wife shecouldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phoneticdictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it upvery quickly.""Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they moveto the West.""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach themhow to eat, and when to make tea.""PITFALLSBut not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went toSwitzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency.

""But it was the worst time of my life.""Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensureunsuitable candidates are weeded out.""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on allcomers.""Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof thearrangement can work.

"Regarding:Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.Thanks for your replies.... However i still cant get it to detect the External USB modem. I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than enough for 1 PC ).It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more difficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!!

Otherwise, if a file becomes corrupted, you'll never know it, unless you keep your own checksums.  There are only a small handful of filesystems that keep checksums of your files.  Btrfs and ZFS come to mind.  I believe ZFS is more mature than Btrfs, but it isn't in the kernel.  I believe the only way to get ZFS on Linux is through FUSE.There's also JFS, which has been around for a number of years, and is mature.  It doesn't checksum your files, but it does use copy-on-write (as do Btrfs and ZFS), which goes a long way to keeping your data from getting corrupted, something XFS does not do.So if Btrfs were more mature, or if ZFS were included in the kernel, I'd recommend either of those.  But as it is, I think JFS is the way to go.-- Kevin--",not spam

Texas Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- andpocketed 11 times its investment.Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airwayscustomers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New YorkTimes. The airline will even continue to track and to honorfrequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can useU.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner,United.

Once storiesfade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in thissummer of corporate scandals, remembering back to GlobalCrossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads.The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Fridaya ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention,especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in theChapter 11 aisle.

"rossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- andthat's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Backin January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, threetimes that much, and from the very same investment team, Asianconglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore TechnologiesTelemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how thedeal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, andbondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from theslice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing.

Actually, it says that the session lasted less than ten seconds, but who's counting.This started happening last Monday night after doing a full-upgrade on my laptop, running Squeeze.In reality:  If I click on OK (the only button available) then the session does indeed end and I am dropped back to a login window.  If I click the 'X' button, the same thing happens.  If I click the 'Minimize' button, however, the message just goes away (it does not appear in the task bar) and I can continue to work as if nothing had happened.I thought that maybe I just had something messed up in some configuration file in my home directory, so I tried creating a new user to see if it still happened there.

"TCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the MassesWhile security experts poke and jab at what bits and piecesof the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, theyhave tended to focus on how they work and what they imply asfar as concerns such as privacy and security go, oralternatively, in terms of how they would impact thefunctionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analystsboth favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them fromthese standpoints, while paying much less attention to whatthe proposals imply from the standpoint of what contentcontrol itself really means.The most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is notwhether they may interfere with the power of the universallogic device, or whether they are effectual from thestandpoint of privacy and security concerns, though theseare all very important concerns.

Today Inoticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqiovertures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi warpreparations (digging bunkers etc).At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation onmultiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisiblepreferably) is somewhat appealing.

Some minor setup details are omitted from the diagramto keep it simple, such as the fact that /boot is a mirrored 100MB partitionset and that there are two non mirrored 1GB swap partitions.  / and /var aremirrored partitions in the remaining first 30GB.

For a small/medium office server running sayPostfix/Dovecot/Samba/lighty+Roundcube webmail, a small intranet etc, the 4drive setup would yield significantly better performance than the highercapacity 2 drive setup.

However, due to U.S. military activities on theisland and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government ofthe Kingdom lingers in ""exile"".

Few peoplein the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named theatoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constantjurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry andcultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, thegovernment is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodialtitle to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty atthe will of the people.

"Clearly, the so-calledannexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patentlyillegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the HawaiianMonarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturallysignificant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedentwas thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of WakeIsland. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratakchain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion ofMicronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshallgroup.

"This is preaty neat.- Adam L.

Although the PhD student has beenblind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutleryand drinks.""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can'tfind my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dishis -- Lasagne?

Has anyone heard of a Mac equivalent?What about a java launcher stub. Use Runtime exec to launch a java  process. I think this is what the Apache common launcher project code  amounts to. It is based on the Tomcat or some such product launcher  code and uses a ant task approach but I think in the end just amounts  to Runtime exec'd java.

KDE 4.4 sounds great but it isnowhere to be found in Debian but in experimental and it sounds like itis nowhere near ready for production.  3.5.10 is truly and completely,unusably broken for calendaring other than in a standalone world.It looks like Evolution has introduced webdav support for contacts in2.24 and we can grab 2.28 from testing.

"hi all,I am setting up a file server for a small company. The people who will be using it want to be able to control who accesses particular directories on a user/group basis. I originally thought that it would be enough to set up a standard samba system with unix home directories, plus shares for each group of users (admin / tech etc.), but they are keen to have a system which allows them to make some parts of the filesystem available to more than one group, which as far as I know isn't supported by this kind of setup. (Unless I were to have shares for each possible combination of groups...)I think that to achieve this I will need to set up samba with unix ACLs, but I'm not sure what's the best way of doing this - the two options seem to be using a patched kernel with an ext3 filesystem, or else using the XFS filesystem which has built in ACL support. Which of these would you recommend?The XFS option seems a lot simpler to maintain (no need to patch the kernel every time an update is",not spam

More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on CNET Radio every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.Sincerely,David CourseyExecutive EditorAnchorDesk",not spam

""Duncan"" Beberg  http://www.mithral.com/~beberg/  beberg@mithral.com--------EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause CancerWed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ETBy H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press WriterWASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and othersources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental ProtectionAgency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government'spush to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning enginesand diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects ofexposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studi",not spam
"es involving bothanimal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancerrisk to humans.""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmentalexposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human healtheffects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions anduncertainties are involved.""The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from variousworld health agencies and studies in California and is particularlysignificant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates dieselemissions under the Clean Air Act.Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bushadministration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation thatwould establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and aseparate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead withthe tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White",not spam
"House approval,the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postponethe requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail tomeet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuelis expected to produce pollution reductions.The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate theprobability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure todiesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA whengauging pollution health concerns.But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data areconsidered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate ofcancer risk to an individual.Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animaland other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to becarcinoge",not spam
"nic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies toenvironmental exposure.""The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts posesshort-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma andother respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account foras much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needsto be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-roaddiesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agencyexpects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaustsources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a privateenvironmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure toharmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully",not spam

" an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online.The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice  and Industry Canada , wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in early 2003.Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty , which the country is in the process of considering.If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for u",not spam
"p to six months, and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In most circumstances, a court order would be required for government agents to conduct Internet monitoring.Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty , which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted , or ratified, the treaty.Michael Geist , a professor at the University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems weak.""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a",not spam
"particularly convincing argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case.""Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems.""Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , but it applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be responsible for paying the costs",not spam
"of buying new equipment.Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center  (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data."" EPIC opposes  the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights.Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" the draft says.Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea",not spam
".""""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet anonymously,"" Hosein said.A representative for George Radwanski , Canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on the paper as it stands.""Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca  no later than Nov. 15.",not spam

Several people pointedout, that the debian installation system already supports loadingfirmware [15] from a separate installation media, e.g. a USB stick.

The Ashburn native says he wants to dosomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""youcan't get the chicks with that anymore.""The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams ofsome fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the techbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments hascome to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association.

""It can be hard to see this, because atsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so farexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer sciencedepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George WashingtonUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computerscience fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in thepast decade.

For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studyinginformation technology and engineering at George Mason University werecomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major isdown to 800, although a newly created and more general informationtechnology major has attracted 200 students.""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend fouryears on something and then not get a job.""Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer scien",not spam

Marylanddecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone doesnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College ofComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring theirinterest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's afactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expectto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are nolonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is notconvinced that's the case.

People are saying, 'I don't need thiskind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industryis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down theroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going tofind themselves in a shortage situation.""Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but otherfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and socialinfluences, also come into play, sa",not spam

"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more sensibly it would have been a lot harder.See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, ""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma cracking story, and pretty accurate.I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you see....Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma machines and brute-forcing.Eirikur",not spam

"Hi all,I'm trying to get Java1.6 working on my MacBook Pro 1,1 which has  10.5.8 on it. I've downloaded a package from the OpenJDK project, and  I've got it setup using the directionsthat I've found at the bottom of this thread:http://www.mailarky.com/thread.php?page=1=197627where I've setup an OpenJDK6.jar folder in my ~/Library/Java/ JavaVirtualMachines directory. I've got the proper directory  structure, but no luck in having it recognized by the/usr/libexec/java_home function. Nor is it recognized if I try to  symlink it as a the 1.6.0 folder in the /System/Library/.../Versions  path. I think then the culprit may be my Info.plistfile.Does anyone have any experience with doing this setup? I've included  what my Info.plist looks like below to see if it's not formatted  properly.Thanks in advance.--Melih Onvuralhttp://www.onvural.net/melihCFBundleDevelopmentRegionEnglishCFBundleIdentifiercom.example.OpenJDKCFBundleExecutablelibjava.dylibCFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion6.0CFBundleNameOpen",not spam

"> > Tom said:> >> > The question then becomes, why is knowledge sharing such a difficult > > thing in organizations?And Owen replied:> Well, IMNHO, its because companies do not reward knowledge sharers. When I don't work in this area, but I have a suspicion that many peoplesuspect projects for ""knowledge management"" and ""knowledge sharing"" asattempts to eliminate their jobs, or at least their importance. If ""theorganization"" knows all the things I know, why does it need me?This should actually be easy to test experimentally: compare the resultsof having someone call up and say, ""Can you show us how to do X for thisproject we're working on?"" with those of having someone summoned by aknowledge management project to explain how to do X for the knowledgearchives.    - Winhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",not spam

Ralsky is a prime candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law.

Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude photos:http://belps.freewebsites.com/I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in confirming the validity of the information found online.  There were some ""interesting"" conversations.

Nor does it mention the Sorenson Spark Codec that is used for video encoding in Flash 6 and 7, and remains the choice of some users still for Flash video because other formats convert easily to it. Both may be encumbered by patents but, without them, the information that Adobe has released is of limited use.""> I always thought that the reason for all the trouble with Flash on Linux> is that Flash was",not spam
"a closed standard.  If the spec is published, why are> the FLOSS players so far behind Adobe's player?  Is it just that> difficult to design a good player?As per the above link, it seems not all the specs have been released or made publicly available. There are also some concerns about software patents (for using -and distributing- MP3 codecs or FLV).Anyway, I agree with your ""hidden demand"" ;-)Look at PDF. PDF became a ISO/IEC standard but we (at linux) still lack for a PDF editor that can compete with Acrobat Professional.

"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85497383Date: Not suppliedThis is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment!     U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in     rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental     revolution.     Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment     suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a     person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her     own cells.     ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in     biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize     dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that     focuses on oral and facial science.

It came from the RSP's and the Equity funds and the Investments of individual working class -- people who believed these reports and invested.

She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing.     The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my     lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again.

They could threaten me, but if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors.

But the energyindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justifysoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financialand fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning whateveryone suspected.

His ruling came a few days afterCalifornia's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricitygenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully workedthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in amemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy torelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving anycongestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to beseen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits andpolicy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'grips -- we would need a willing federal partner.

That's areasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea ifit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put theutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center forEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --tempting but a bad idea.

"nstead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way toinject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricitydefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulationis essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougerscontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more ofboth.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets upthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilitieswill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewablesources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customermodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining.

California hasn'tdone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers didreact to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it'slunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid italtogether.Maybe this is all pointless.

It was onlyas I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, andqueried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist onthe new rootfs.

"Hi,On my netbook I'm using automatic USB sticks mount through udev rules,and I already used to running 'sync' command before unplugging stick,so no data will be lost.

But once you get it running,don't use synaptic.  I've heard that it does not respect apt pinning.)--   .''`.

"On Tue, Aug 13, 2002 at 06:54:28AM +0100, Anders Holm mentioned:> let me guess, you haven't tried the boot parameter root=/dev/hda2 if you> are using lilo?? Ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. They have an openboot-like promthat looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else. The only way I think you can set parameters is with a ""set_params"" line. However, when I run     set_params root=/dev/hda2 and then run:    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz It boots the old kernel, I assume from the prom. It seems to do this, ifsomething goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel. BTW, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.Kate-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.iehttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.List maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie",not spam
"Can you post some details? I haven't done any serious benchmarking, but I haven't seen a scenario where something 'seemed' significantly slower, and in all cases I've tried (GUI applications and J2EE applications) the memory footprint was significantly smaller). I imagine a codebase that would not benefit much from compressed OOPs would be one relying primarily on manipulating primitive data types, but in that scenario I don't see how performance would be impacted. I'd love to see your data, and if anyone has some insight on the potential performance tradeoffs with compressed OOPs, please share!-- ErikOn Apr 26, 2010, at 9:30 PM, Benson Margulies wrote:> A quick benchmark of some CPU-intensive code of ours shows a quite marked slowdown with that option turned on. _______________________________________________Do not post admin requests to the list.

Again this is just a personalperception.
